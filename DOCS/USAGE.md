## Usage

- Replace `"path/to/your/Dockerfile"` with the actual path to your Dockerfile.
- Run the script using `python teleoperator.py`.
- It will print out the relevant details for each instruction found in the Dockerfile.

Remember that this script is a starting point, and you can enhance it further based on your specific needs. 
Additionally, consider using existing Dockerfile parsing libraries (e.g., `teleoperator`) for more robust solutions.


### Run local as command line

```bash
teleoperator build
```

run service local

```bash
teleoperator run
```

### Run remote as command line


```bash
teleoperator run remote ssh://
```





### Run as a Service

Serve as a service docker swarm, kubernetes, podman, ...
in nginx, caddy, express, 


```bash
teleoperator run nginx
```

```bash
teleoperator --file Dockerfile run nginx --config nginx.conf
```

run service local

```bash
teleoperator serve remote ssh://
```

### Run by Hypervisor

Serve as a virtual service docker swarm, kubernetes, podman, ...

```bash
teleoperator run kube
```


```bash
teleoperator run docker
```



```bash
teleoperator run swarm
```


### Development

Designing the Object Detection Application
Now that we have our environment set up, let's dive into the process of designing our object detection application. We will be using the Haar cascade classifier, a popular method for object detection.

Step 1: Importing the Required Libraries
Start by importing the necessary libraries:
```python 
import cv2 
```

Step 2: Loading the Pre-trained Model
Next, load the pre-trained model using the cv2.CascadeClassifier class:
```python 
cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('path_to_cascade.xml') 
```

Step 3: Reading and Preprocessing the Image
Read the image and convert it to grayscale:
```python
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg') gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) 
```

Step 4: Detecting Objects
Now, detect the objects in the image using the detectMultiScale method:

```python
objects = cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30)) 
```

Step 5: Drawing Rectangles around Detected Objects
Finally, iterate over the detected objects and draw rectangles around them:

```python
for (x, y, w, h) in objects: cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2) 
```
